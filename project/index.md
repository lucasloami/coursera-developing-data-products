Introduction

This presentation is part of the Course Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class. The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application. This presentation adresses the second part of the course project.

The app developed for the first part of the assignment is avalilable at: [shiny app](https://lucasloami.shinyapps.io/course_project/

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasloami/coursera-developing-data-products)
